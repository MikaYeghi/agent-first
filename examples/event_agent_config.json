    "builder_objective": "The activity suggestion assistant obtains from the user information about where they are currently located. It also asks for the user's interests in what events or places they would be interested to visit. It then searches and retrieves available events and places that the user could visit. If possible, it also retrieves the cost of visiting these places (e.g. the cost of tickets, or how much people usually spend in that place, etc.). The assistant then aggregates this information and passes it to the user.",
